Problem 1: User Profile Card Update
Your webpage contains a user profile card. The profile card is a <div> element with an id of "profile-card", and it has a data attribute data-status that is initially set to "inactive". The card also contains some text indicating the user's name.

a) Retrieve the current status
b) Update the status if needed
c) Update the styling dynamically
Change the background color of the profile card to "lightblue" and the text color to "pink".
d) Update the text content
Use innerText to append " (Active)" to the current text of the profile card.
e) Wrap the updated text
Use innerHTML to wrap the entire updated text inside a <strong> tag.
For example, if the text becomes "User: John Doe (Active)", the final HTML inside the <div> should be <strong>User: John Doe (Active)</strong>.

Problem 3: Notification Message Update
a) Use getAttribute to check if data-read is "false".
b) Use setAttribute to update data-read to "true".
c) Use dynamic style to change the text color to "red" (indicating attention).
d) Use innerText to append " (Read)" to the current notification text.
e) Use innerHTML to wrap the final text inside an <em> tag.

Problem 4: Product Price Tag Update
a) Use getAttribute to read the data-discount attribute.
b) If the discount is "none", use setAttribute to change it to "applied".
c) Use dynamic style to change the text color to "orange" (to highlight a discount).
d) Use innerText to append " (Discount Applied)" to the price.
e) Use innerHTML to wrap the updated text inside a <strong> tag.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Problem 5: Alert Box Activation
a) Use getAttribute to read the data-active attribute.
b) If the state is "off", use setAttribute to change data-active to "on".
c) Use dynamic style to set the border to "2px solid yellow" and background color to "lightyellow". 
d) Use innerText to update the text to "Alert: System Active". 
e) Use innerHTML to wrap the updated text inside a <b> tag.

Problem 7: Dynamic Status Badge Upgrade
a) Use getAttribute to check the data-level attribute (possible values: "basic", "advanced", "elite"). 
b) Use getAttribute to check the data-upgraded attribute (possible values: "no", "yes"). 
c) Based on the following logic:
- If data-level is "basic" and data-upgraded is "no":
- Use setAttribute to change data-level to "advanced" and data-upgraded to "yes".
- Use dynamic style to set the background color to "silver" and text color to "blue".
- Use innerText to append " (Upgraded to Advanced)" to the current text.
- Use innerHTML to wrap the updated text in a <u> tag.

- If data-level is "advanced" and data-upgraded is "no":
- Use setAttribute to change data-level to "elite" and data-upgraded to "yes".
- Use dynamic style to set the background color to "gold" and text color to "black".
- Use innerText to append " (Upgraded to Elite)" to the current text.
- Use innerHTML to wrap the updated text in a <strong> tag.

If data-upgraded is "yes", do nothing (no changes).
